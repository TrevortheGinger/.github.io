                    <p>Hello! My name is Trevor Ladner, I am a senior at Purdue University studying Mechanical Engineering. I also am pursuing minors in Political Science,
					Intellectual Property Law, and Engineering and Public Policy. On campus, I am heavily involved. I am a Crew Chief for the Honors College Racing Crew - the Honors College
					team that competes in the annual Purdue Grand Prix. As Crew Chief, I make all of the final engineering, strategy, and management decisions for the kart I am in charge of. 
					Before being Crew Chief, I have also served as the Assistant Director managing the teams budget and other behind the scenes aspects. I have also been the Vice President of the 
					Purdue Mechanical Engineering Ambassadors. In this role, I was in charge of managing each of our committees making sure that they accomplish the goals laid out by the 
					executive board. For the ambassadors, I currently serve as the Student Activies committee head. In this role, I lead my committee in hosting events for the mechanical engineering
					student body as a whole to promote community, inclusion, and fun. I also serve as Webmaster for the Beta Sigma chapter of Tau Beta Sigma - the honorary band sorority. 
					I am also the Lead TA for ENGR 16100/200 on campus. This is the honors first year engineering course. In this role, I manage software and physical components for course projects - 
					this includes determining bugs in the project operating system and implementing updates to solve the issues. Outside of all this, I love rooting for Purdue Athletics (sitting as low 
					as I can for every Purdue Basketball game), spending time with friends, watching any form of racing, baking, and watching movies.</p>
					</p> Feel free to reach out to me!</p>
