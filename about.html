                    <p style="color:#fff">Hello! My name is Trevor Ladner, I am a recent graduate of Purdue University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with Honors Distinction. I also earned minors in 
                      Intellectual Property Law, Political Science, and Engineering and Public Policy. I am currently working at Rivian Automotive as a Trail Engineer in their engineering rotational development program.
                      I have interned twice before at Rivian, both times focusing my work on vehicle interior validation topics. I've especially focused on validation related to FMVSS regulations and interior material
                      testing. Prior to joining Rivian, I had an internship with Magna Seating of America in which I also focused on core engineering topics such as test execution and DFMEA. While at Purdue, I was
                      heaving involved with the Honors College Racing Crew - a team that competes in the annual Purdue Grand Prix. On the team, I served in various roles such as Crew Chief, Assistant Director, and 
                      PR/Sponsorshp Lead. In these roles, I performed tasks from budget management to overseeing the engineering and racing strategy for one of our go karts. I also served as Vice President of the Purdue 
                      Mechanical Engineering Ambassadors in which I oversaw each of the committees in the organization. Apart from this I was a member in Purdue Bands as well as a member of Tau Beta Sigma, the honorary
                      band sorotiy. I was also the Lead TA for ENGR 16100/200 on campus. This is the honors first year engineering course. In this role, I managed software and physical components for course projects - 
					            this included determining bugs in the project operating system and implementing updates to solve the issues. Outside of all this, I love rooting for Purdue Athletics, spending time with friends, 
                      watching any form of racing, baking, hiking, kayaking, and watching movies.</p>
					          
                      <p style="color:#fff"> Feel free to reach out to me!</p>
