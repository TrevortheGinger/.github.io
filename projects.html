            desire to be more rugged than the current material in use. I started working with multiple suppliers and did an early feasbility check based on cost of the material, sustainable content, and ability to pass
            a few select tests that were most critical for this application. From this, we did a small scale trial of the materials to determine which of the few we believed would meet our requirements. This led to our 
            top choice material that was presented to leadership and a full-scale trial completed. This material also underwent our material testing. In the material testing, one test failed our specification due to conditions
            at the manufacturing facility. I collaborated with the supplier to root-cause the issue and approve a prevention plan to ensure the issue no longer persisted. NOTE: The image is just representative and does not

              suppliers currently in automotive applications and many not in automotive at all to learn about the sustainable materials they offer. Promising materials were then put through to testing and trialing to
              determine possible applicability in future programs. I specifically had to work regularly with designers and suppliers that had no experience meeting automotive specifications to develop materials that 
              met our sustainability targets while still being able to pass all test criteria. NOTE: The image is just representative and does not contain the material discussed herewithin.</p>

            <p style="color:#fff"> My final school project was my senior design project. For this project, my team set out to create a simple solution for salons that allowed them to control and set the temperature of the 
              water in a shampoo bowl using an electronic interface. The system would maintain a steady state temperature that was preset by the stylist. It also allowed for the stylist and the client to make incremental
              temperature changes without drastic changes to the system. The biggest innovation to this design was that it coupled directly to an existing faucet handle with the simple removal of 1 set screw. This made it 
              incredibly versatile and easy to install for anyone and does not require any alterations to the plumbing. This device ended up working really well. In the poster linked below, you are able to see how it met 
              all of our customer requirements and even see a video of the device in action. We took second place in the Malott Innovation and Design Competion at Purdue amongst all ME Undergrad senior design projects.</p>
